This is an expansion of my 112 Term Project. I've become a much better programmer since then, but I'm still enthralled with the phenomenon of learners adapting to each other's learning progress, so I've made some improvements.

Sheepworld is a world where sheep are stranded on a meadow planet where a wolf randomly appears, kills the first sheep it can get to, then disappears, and so on. The sheep have strategies that dictate their paths, and these are passed on to new sheep by sexual reproduction.

After only a few minutes spent on sheepworld, you'll probably notice that the sheep are quick learners - after only a few generations, they discover that they can find safety in numbers and close quarters.

Sheepworld is effectively a torus, so sheep don't need to be aware of their absolute positions, only their relative positions.

On sheepworld, a sheep may have more than two parents, and it's possible for a sheep to be a parent more than once to the same child (i.e. contributes more genes).

The mutation rate on sheepworld is inversely proportional to the genetic diversity on sheepworld as a whole.

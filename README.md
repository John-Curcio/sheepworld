This is an expansion of my 112 Term Project. I've become a much better programmer since then, but I'm still enthralled with the phenomenon of learners adapting to each other's learning progress, so I've made some improvements.

Sheepworld is a world where sheep are stranded on a meadow planet where a wolf randomly appears, kills the first sheep it can get to, then disappears, and so on. The sheep have strategies that dictate their paths, and these are passed on to new sheep by sexual reproduction.
